        <p>
          <strong>Civil claims</strong>, in both Islamic jurisprudence (Shariah
          law) and international legal terminology, refer to disputes concerning
          personal rights, financial matters, property ownership, and other
          non-criminal issues. These claims primarily deal with the enforcement
          and protection of private rights rather than penal sanctions.
        </p>

        <h3>In Islamic (Shariah) Law</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Civil claims (دعوې مدني) encompass disputes related to ownership
            (ملکیت), tenancy (سرای) housing (کور), and land ownership (ځمکې
            ملکیت). These claims are adjudicated based on principles derived
            from the Quran, Hadith, and Islamic legal scholarship.
          </li>
          <li>
            Property rights are protected under Shariah, emphasizing justice,
            fairness, and the fulfillment of contractual obligations.
          </li>
          <li>
            The resolution of such claims involves mediation, arbitration, or
            court judgments that align with Islamic ethical and legal standards.
          </li>
          <li>
            Financial disputes and personal rights claims are also addressed
            within this framework, ensuring that parties receive their due
            rights without violating Islamic prohibitions such as usury (riba)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>In International Legal Terminology</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Civil claims refer to legal actions brought to resolve disputes
            between private parties over rights and obligations, excluding
            criminal offenses.
          </li>
          <li>
            These include claims related to ownership of movable and immovable
            property, contractual disagreements, torts, and family law matters.
          </li>
          <li>
            The legal framework governing these claims is based on codified
            civil laws, international treaties, and conventions where
            applicable.
          </li>
          <li>
            International law recognizes the protection of property rights and
            personal claims through mechanisms like civil litigation,
            arbitration, and alternative dispute resolution.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          Civil claims in both Shariah and international law cover disputes
          involving personal and financial rights, especially concerning
          property such as houses, land, and tenancy rights. They focus on
          resolving conflicts through legal processes that uphold ownership
          rights and contractual duties without involving criminal penalties.
          This dual perspective ensures that such claims are addressed with
          respect to religious principles in Islamic contexts and codified legal
          standards internationally Here is a detailed explanation in literary
          English of the specified legal terms—property ownership disputes,
          tenancy (rental) conflicts, inheritance division and wills, claims for
          compensation, and disputes over deeds and transfers—within the
          framework of Islamic (Sharia) law and international legal principles:
        </p>

        <h3>Types of Civil Disputes</h3>
        <strong
          >1. Property Ownership, Houses, and Land Ownership Disputes:</strong
        >
        <ul style="list-style-type: none; text-align: justify">
          <li>
            In Islamic jurisprudence, ownership of property, including houses
            and land, is governed by principles derived from the Quran and the
            Sunnah, interpreted through schools of Islamic law such as Hanafi or
            Jafari. Ownership rights are respected and protected, but disputes
            often arise regarding rightful possession, inheritance, or transfer
            of property. Sharia mandates clear documentation (qabalah or deed)
            and lawful transfer procedures to establish ownership. Disputes are
            frequently resolved through a combination of formal courts applying
            Islamic law and informal community mechanisms such as elders or
            Jirga, which aim to reconcile parties in accordance with Sharia and
            customary law (urf), provided these do not contradict Islamic
            principles. The courts often supervise and record such settlements
            to ensure compliance with Sharia
          </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>2. Tenancy (Lease or Rental) Disputes:</strong>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none; text-align: justify">
          <li>
            Conflicts arising from tenancy agreements, including rent payment
            and property use, are addressed under Islamic contract law, which
            emphasizes fairness, mutual consent, and fulfillment of contractual
            obligations. The lessor and lessee have clearly defined rights and
            duties, and disputes are settled by courts or local dispute
            resolution bodies. Islamic law prohibits exploitation and unjust
            enrichment, thus protecting tenants from arbitrary eviction or
            excessive rent. Informal dispute resolution mechanisms also play a
            vital role in resolving such conflicts swiftly and amicably
          </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>3. Inheritance Division, Wills, and Succession:</strong>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none; text-align: justify">
          <li>
            Inheritance under Islamic law is a well-defined and detailed system
            derived from Quranic injunctions, particularly in Surah An-Nisa. The
            shares of heirs—such as children, spouses, parents, and siblings—are
            fixed and obligatory. Wills (wasiyyah) may allocate up to one-third
            of the estate to non-heirs or charitable causes, but cannot override
            the mandatory shares. Disputes over inheritance are common and often
            involve women’s rights, which Sharia explicitly protects, though
            customary practices may marginalize them. Formal courts and
            religious authorities enforce inheritance rights according to
            Islamic jurisprudence, often involving community elders to mediate.
            The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, for example, has institutional
            mechanisms like the Amr bil-Maruf to enforce Sharia in inheritance
            disputes, ensuring women receive their rightful shares despite
            social challenges
          </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>4. Claims for Compensation (Damages):</strong>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none; text-align: justify">
          <li>
            Claims for compensation in Islamic law arise when harm or loss
            (daman or ta'awun) is caused to a person or property. The principle
            of justice requires that the injured party be compensated fairly,
            restoring them to their prior position as much as possible.
            Compensation may be monetary or involve restitution. Islamic legal
            tradition provides detailed rules on liability and damages,
            emphasizing accountability and fairness. Dispute resolution often
            involves both formal courts and customary mechanisms, with religious
            scholars playing a role in interpreting applicable laws and ensuring
            just outcomes
          </li>
        </ul>

        <strong>5. Disputes over Deeds, Titles, and Transfers:</strong>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none; text-align: justify">
          <li>
            Disputes concerning the validity of deeds (qabalah), title
            documents, and property transfers are common in jurisdictions where
            formal land registration systems coexist with customary and Islamic
            legal traditions. Islamic law requires clear, consensual, and
            documented transfer of ownership to prevent disputes. Courts and
            local councils examine the authenticity of deeds, adherence to legal
            formalities, and the intent of parties. Informal dispute resolution
            bodies and religious authorities often assist in mediating
            conflicts, ensuring that transfers comply with Sharia and protect
            the rights of all parties involved. The integration of Islamic and
            customary law aims to provide accessible, culturally legitimate, and
            effective resolution
